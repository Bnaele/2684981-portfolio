            <h3>Latest Project</h3>
            <p>
                My latest project is a Course Forum Android application that allows
                students to post questions, submit answers, and vote on helpful
                responses. The system includes user authentication, OTP verification,
                and a PHP backend integrated with a MySQL database.
